Quaternions tend to behave better for small values if I remember correctly, 
    and are much easier to interpolate (i.e., rotate from a to b over t seconds). 
For rotation matrices, you need to re-calculate all of the trig values for each intermediate step, 
    whereas for quaternions you simply have a linear combination of your start and end quaternions.
